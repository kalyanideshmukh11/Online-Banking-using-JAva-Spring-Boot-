# Team Project: Online banking system

A banking application which exposes API calls to add new accounts, perform transactions and view transaction history.

## Design Decisions  
### Springboot  
Using the spring framework for our application allowed us to set up Java application with easily testable and reusable code.
The configuration required to get the application running was minimal as a result.  
The added support for data access frameworks like hibernate and JDBC allowed us to easily integrate database transactions into our application.

### MySQL Database hosted on Amazon S3
For an application heaviliy dependant on integrity of data like the online banking system, a relational database was found to be a more reliable option to maintain data consistency and ease of monitoring data.
The database instance was hosted on Amazon's S3 cloud storage during development. This approach provided two advantages:  
1. All team members could perform development testing in sync.
2. No need to re-deploy database instance

### Amazon AWS Auto Scaled EC2 Cluster
Auto scaling automatically monitors and adjusts resources allocation to provide reliable perfonmance of applications hosted on AWS under variable workloads.
This step will let us ensure that we have the optimum number of EC2 instances available to handle the load of the banking system.
